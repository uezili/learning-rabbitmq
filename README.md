This repository contains connections to RabbitMQ running in a compose docker. With some practical examples, I understood how the "Advanced Message Queuing Protocol" (AMQP) scheme works, which the messaging service uses in its working scheme. I understood how a consumer works to listen to the queues and receive messages sent from a publisher, which sends messages to the queues. I learned about exchanges and their uses so the message arrives in the correct queue.
